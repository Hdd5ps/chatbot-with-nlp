# Chatbot NLP Project

This project implements a chatbot using Python and natural language processing (NLP) libraries such as NLTK and SpaCy. The chatbot is trained on a dataset of customer service interactions to improve response accuracy and is integrated with a web interface using Flask.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd chatbot-nlp
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask application:
   ```
   python src/app.py
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the chatbot interface.

## Usage Guidelines

- Interact with the chatbot by typing your queries in the input field and pressing enter.
- The chatbot will respond based on the training it received from the customer service interactions dataset.

## Additional Information

- Ensure that you have the necessary NLP libraries installed (NLTK, SpaCy) as specified in `requirements.txt`.
- Modify `config.py` for any environment-specific settings or API keys if needed.
